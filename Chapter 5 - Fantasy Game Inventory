# You are creating a fantasy video game. 
# The data structure to model the player’s inventory will be a dictionary where the keys are string values describing the item in the inventory and the value is an integer value detailing how many of that item the player has. 
# For example, the dictionary value {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12} means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.
# Write a function named displayInventory() that would take any possible “inventory” and display it like the following:
# Inventory:
# 12 arrow
# 42 gold coin
# 1 rope
# 6 torch
# 1 dagger
# Total number of items: 62'''

def displayInventory(inventory):
    print("Inventory:")
    item_total = 0
    for k, v in inventory.items():
        print(str(inventory.get(k)) + ' ' + k)
        item_total = item_total + inventory.get(k)
    print("Total number of items: " + str(item_total))
   
   
# Imagine that a vanquished dragon’s loot is represented as a list of strings like this:
# dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']
# Write a function named addToInventory(inventory, addedItems), where the inventory parameter is a dictionary representing the player’s inventory (like in the previous project) and the addedItems parameter is a list like dragonLoot. 
# The addToInventory() function should return a dictionary that represents the updated inventory. Note that the addedItems list can contain multiples of the same item.

def addToInventory(inventory, addedItems):
    for item in addedItems:
        inventory[item] = inventory.get(item,0) + 1
    return inventory
